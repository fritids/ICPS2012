ICPS 2012 acceptance notification

Dear {$first_name},


Congratulations! You have been accepted to the International Conference of Physics Students 2012.

In order to get finally accepted you will have to do two things:
1. Confirm that you are still willing to attend by replying to this email. If you don't reply before Friday, July 27th, we will have to revoke your admission again.
2. Provide us with some additional information as soon as possible on www.icps2012.com/dashboard/
3. Transfer the participation fee and possible IAPS membership fee to our bank account before Saturday, July 28th. Please also email us proof of payment right away, as international bank transfers take a few days.

For you as an early registrant the participation fee is 180 EUR. If you do not have access to an IAPS National or Local committee (www.iaps.info/members) you have to become an individual member if you are not already one yet. The fee is 10 EUR, which can be paid together with the participation fee, we will transfer it to IAPS. 

Any transaction costs have to be paid by you, so please check these costs at your bank. If you want to pay for a group at once, please contact us first.
