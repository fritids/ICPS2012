ICPS 2012 payment reminder (last call)

Dear {$first_name},


Over a month ago, we approved your application for the ICPS 2012. The payment deadline was set to April 6. As far as we can see, we have not received the required registration fee from you by now.

We send you this email as a last reminder for completing your payment. Since you are already overdue, the early registration discount is not applicable anymore. If you still want to participate, please transfer your registration fee (now 200 EUR) within a few days. This Saturday, we'll be revoking admissions for accounts with incomplete payment.

If you still have to make your transfer, please notify us, as international bank transfers can take a few days.

Also, please be aware that this is an automated email. If you have been in touch with the committee about your situation, you can safely disregard this message. If you made your transfer in the last couple of days, it might be that it hasn't yet been registered to our systems. In that case, also please email us, just to be sure.

For your convenience, here are the required transfer details:

The transaction details:
