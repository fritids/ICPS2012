You are scheduled to present a lecture. If you'd like to accompany your lecture by a digital presentation, we would like to receive the file before the end of breakfast on the day of your lecture at the latest. You can do this by emailing it to presentation@icps2012.com, or handing over a USB Flash drive containing the presentation to a member of the organising committee. We ask this so that we can transfer the presentation to the computer in the lecture room, which will save time and frustrations during the sessions.
