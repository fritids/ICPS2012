If you are scheduled to give a lecture and would like to accompany your talk by a digital presentation, we would like to receive the file before the end of breakfast on the day of your lecture at the latest. You can do this by emailing it to presentation@icps2012.com, or handing over a USB Flash drive containing the presentation to a member of the organising committee. We ask this so that we can transfer the presentation to the computer in the lecture room, which will save time and frustrations during the sessions.

If you are presenting a poster, please bring a printed version of it, preferably size A0. The poster session will take place on Monday, August 6th.


Although you wil receive a print version upon arrival, you can already check out the general information booklet at http://www.icps2012.com/general-information.pdf. The same holds for the abstracts booklet for the student lectures, which can be found at http://www.icps2012.com/studentabstracts.pdf. If you are unsure whether you are scheduled to present a lecture yourself, please check this booklet thoroughly.

We hope to see you next week! If you have some remaining questions, do not hesitate to contact us by email or phone.


Kind regards,

On behalf of the ICPS 2012 committee,
Joren Brunekreef
