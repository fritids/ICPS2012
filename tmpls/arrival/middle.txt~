After check-in, you will probably want to drop off your luggage at your accommodation location. Since riding a bicycle might be hard enough, we have arranged for a luggage transportation service. To make sure you don't lose your luggage, please attach name tags to all your bags.

You will not need to bring any bedsheets. However, we do not provide towels, so don't forget to bring your own.
