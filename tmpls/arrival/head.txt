Dear {$first_name},

We are only one week away from the International Conference of Physics Students 2012. Hopefully, you're as excited as we are! We send you this email in order to provide you with some useful information concerning your arrival and stay in Utrecht.

We hope you have already made travel arrangements for coming here. Directions to the check-in desk can be found at http://www.icps2012.com/location/travel-information/. Check-in will take place at the UCU Campus (starting 09:00 AM), regardless of your accommodation location. If you are planning to drive here by car, you can park your vehicle here for the duration of the week. For walking directions from the bus stop (from Central Station, take line 4 to Burg. Fockema Andrealaan, exit at Hobbemastraat) nearest to the campus, please check http://goo.gl/maps/fIId.
