ICPS 2012 - Early arrival instructions

Dear {$first_name},


Our records indicate that you have booked an extra night before the start of ICPS 2012. In addition to the general information email, we would like to provide you with some specific early arrival information.

The accommodation for the extra night will be the StayOkay Hostel in Bunnik, regardless of your accommodation location for the rest of the week. We will have a check-in desk ready at the hostel on the 3rd of August from 16:00 to 20:00. If you expect to arrive earlier or later than this, please contact us. If you do not find us present upon arrival, please talk to the hostel staff. They will have a list of names of people who arrive early, so they'll be able to show you your room. If this happens, do not forget to check in to the conference later on. Also, please note that you won't be able to get access to your room before 15:00. on August 3rd. 

Upon arrival, you are required to complete a payment of EUR {$required_payment}. Again, we can only accept cash, so please make sure you bring enough.
