Although you wil receive a print version upon arrival, you can already check out the general information booklet at http://www.icps2012.com/general-information.pdf. The same holds for the abstracts booklet for the student lectures, which can be found at http://www.icps2012.com/studentabstracts.pdf.

We hope to see you next week! If you have some remaining questions, do not hesitate to contact us by email or phone.
