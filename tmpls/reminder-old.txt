ICPS 2012 payment reminder

Dear {$first_name},


A few weeks ago, we approved your application for the ICPS 2012. The payment deadline was set to May 13. As far as we can see, we have not received the required registration fee from you by now.

We're emailing you to remind you of the deadline. There's still a few days left until May 13, so there's still some time to complete your payment. International bank transfers can take a fwe days, so take that into account when making the transfer.

Also, please be aware that this is an automated email. If you have been in touch with the committee about your situation, you can safely disregard this message.

For your convenience, here are the required transfer details:

The transaction details:
