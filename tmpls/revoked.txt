ICPS 2012 - admission revoked

Dear {$first_name},


I'm sorry to inform you that we've revoked your admission to the International Conference of Physics Students 2012. This is probably because you haven't responded to our emails, because we haven't received your registration fee yet, or because you have told us you did not want to go anymore. 

Please note that this is an automated email. If you think we made a mistake, please contact us as soon as possible, so we can set things straight.


Kind regards,

Nikki Bisschop
