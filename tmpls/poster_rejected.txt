ICPS 2012 poster presentation status

Dear {$first_name},


Thank you for applying for presenting a poster at ICPS. There are many participants who want to present a poster, too many for the places we have. Unfortunately, you are not selected. 

It might happen that some of the selected participants will still cancel their application. Then we might reconsider your status and ask you to present your poster after all. If you have any questions, or if you do not want to present a poster anymore, please contact us again.

Also, please note that this is an automated email. If you feel a mistake has been made, please contact us as soon as possible.


Kind regards,

Joren Brunekreef
