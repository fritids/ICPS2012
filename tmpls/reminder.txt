ICPS 2012 payment reminder

Dear {$first_name},


A few weeks ago, we approved your application for the ICPS 2012. The payment deadline was set to April 25. As far as we can see, we have not received the required registration fee from you by now.

We're emailing you to remind you of the deadline. Even though we're already past April 25, we're willing to give a short extension. However, if we haven't received payment in a few days, we'll have to revoke your admission.

International bank transfers can take a few days, so if you made your payment in the last couple of days, it's certainly possible that it hasn't shown up in our records as of yet. If you think this is the case, please contact us, just to be sure.

Also, please be aware that this is an automated email. If you have been in touch with the committee about your situation, you can safely disregard this message.

For your convenience, here are the required transfer details:

The transaction details:
Transaction tag:  {$email_id}

If you're part of a group payment, please contact the people responsible for taking care of this.

We hope to see you in August!


Kind regards,

Joren Brunekreef
