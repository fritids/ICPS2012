We'd like to announce that the student lecture schedule is now available on our website. You can find it at http://www.icps2012.com/studentlectures_schedule.xls

Please note that "Rood", "Wit", "Blauw" and "Waaier" are the names for the rooms you're assigned to. If you're teaming up for a lecture, try looking for names of your partners.
